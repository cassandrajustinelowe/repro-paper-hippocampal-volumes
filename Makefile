# This rule executes the code script, and collects all the latex variables that are printed out
# to the terminal in a file called "results_def.tex". The manuscript will use this file as input.
# The -c option takes the string in the command and hands it to bash.
# The string specifies "set -o pipefail" to check if the workflow executed successfully,
# then executes the script, and collects its stdout stream in results_def.tex using
# a Unix pipe and redirection with tee
